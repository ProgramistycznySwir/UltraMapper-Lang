# UltraMapper Programming Language
UM is interpreted language meant for defining mappings from one format of tree-like document to another.

## It is not meant to be Turing-complete.
In fact it's huge stretch to name it an programming language. Only purpouse of this format is to map one type of tree-based document to other. I'll try to make it as complex as necessary to not rely on any external tools or single-purpouse-functions and in the process that could make this format 

## Tooling:
In the future I would like to experiment with vs-code extension for it, as also making some language-server. Bear in mind that it's just hobby project to create language to brag about, you're free to use it comercially, but beware I'm not responsible for anything.
